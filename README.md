# Deepfake Detection Using Physiological Methods  
*PPG Signal Extraction & PSD Analysis*

## Overview

Deepfake videos are becoming increasingly realistic, making it harder to differentiate them from genuine recordings. Traditional detection methods often rely on visual artifacts, but these can be bypassed by advanced generative models. This project offers a robust alternative by leveraging physiological signals—specifically, the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and its frequency characteristics analyzed via Power Spectral Density (PSD)—to detect inconsistencies in deepfake videos.

## Key Concepts

### Photoplethysmography (PPG) Signal Extraction

PPG is an optical measurement method that detects blood volume changes in tissue. In the context of deepfake detection:
- **Real Videos**: Naturally exhibit subtle color variations in facial regions (forehead, cheeks) that correlate with the heartbeat.
- **Deepfake Videos**: Often lack consistent PPG signals, as generating authentic physiological signals is challenging for deepfake algorithms.

### Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis

PSD analysis measures the frequency content of a signal:
- **Frequency Peaks**: A real PPG signal shows distinct frequency peaks (typically between 0.6–2.5 Hz) corresponding to the heart rate.
- **Detection**: Deepfake videos may have distorted, missing, or inconsistent spectral peaks, which can be used as a marker for authenticity.

## Methodology

### Video Preprocessing

- **Frame Extraction**: Convert the video into individual frames.
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Detection**: Identify facial regions suitable for PPG signal extraction.
- **Noise Reduction**: Apply filtering techniques to minimize lighting and motion artifacts.

### PPG Signal Extraction

- **Color Variation Analysis**: Monitor subtle skin color changes over time.
- **Spatial Averaging**: Average the pixel values within the ROI to suppress noise.
- **Signal Filtering**: Use filters (e.g., Butterworth) to enhance the signal quality.

### PSD Computation

- **Fourier Transform**: Compute the Fourier transform of the extracted PPG signal.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the PSD to identify expected frequency components associated with the heart rate.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features from the PSD for subsequent classification.

### Deepfake Classification

- **Physiological Validation**: Compare the extracted PPG features with expected human physiological patterns.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Optionally, train classifiers on these features to automate the detection of deepfake videos.

## Advantages

- **Robustness**: Physiological signals are inherently difficult for deepfake algorithms to mimic accurately.
- **Non-Invasive**: Analysis is performed directly on video data without the need for additional sensors.
- **Complementary**: This method can be integrated with other detection techniques to improve overall accuracy.

## Challenges & Limitations

- **Video Quality**: Low-resolution or poorly lit videos may impair accurate PPG extraction.
- **Environmental Variability**: Variations in ambient lighting and subject movement can introduce noise.
- **Evolving Techniques**: As deepfake generation methods improve, they may eventually simulate physiological signals more convincingly.
